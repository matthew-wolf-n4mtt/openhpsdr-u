You need the Wireshark sources to compile this Wireshark plug-in. 
It is best to compile Wireshark before compiling the plug-in. 
Compiling Wireshark will validate that you have all libraries needed 
to compile the plug-in. 

Linux
-----
I assume if you are reading this file you have some experience with compiling
open source projects on Linux.

If you do not want to do a full compile of Wireshark, the minimum 
you should do is run the configure (./configure) script.
You need to resolve any issues the configure script discovers.

You may need to use options when running the configure script if
you do not have all the default libraries installed. The default is that
Wireshark GUI will be compiled. Running the configure script with 
"--disable-wireshark" will tell the script not to look for the Xorg, QT, and 
GTK libraries. 

Microsoft Windows 10
--------------------

I started out trying to provide a list of steps nopenhpsr-eeeded to compile the plug-in
on Microsoft Windows. Compiling Wireshark and it's plug-ins for MS Windows is 
not trivial. What I have included in this file is a set of notes on how to 
compile the Wireshark plug-in for Microsoft Windoes 10.  

I assume that if you are reading this file you do not have much experience 
with compiling open source projects on Windows. 

I also assume that you do not have Wireshark installed.

The installation steps for Windows below will include steps to install the 
complier and the needed libraries. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.0 of the plug-in was developed with Wireshark 2.2.3.
This plug-in likely will only work correctly with version 2.2.x of
Wireshark.

These instructions will not include the full compile / build of wireshark
build.The intention of the instructions id to allow you to compile 
the plug-in and then manually copy the plug-in to the correct location.

The INSTALL file in the root directory of the Wireshark tar ball 
provides the details on how to compile Wireshark.


Download the Source
-------------------

At the time this document was created, the link to download
Wireshark was:
https://www.wireshark.org/#download 

1. Down load Wireshark Source.
2. Unpack the source file somewhere. 


Add The Plug-in to The Wireshark Build Files
--------------------------------------------
These instructions are sourced from section "3.2 Permanent addition" 
of the /doc/README.plugins file from the Wireshark source.

Add The Plug-in to The Wireshark Build Files
--------------------------------------------
These instructions are sourced from section "3.2 Permanent addition" 
of the /doc/README.plugins file from the Wireshark source.

1.  Changes to plugins/Makefile.am

The plugins directory contains a Makefile.am.  You need to add to SUBDIRS
the name of your plugin:

SUBDIRS = $(_CUSTOM_SUBDIRS_) \
	...
        wimax \
        wimaxasncp \
	wimaxmacphy \
	hpsdr_u

Add "hpsdr_u" to the end of the list. An example is above. YOU NEED 
TO ADD " \" TO THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE WHERE YOU ADD "hpsdr_u".
Do not add spaces from the beginning of the line, add white space with a TAB.
Also do not add any white space after the "\".

2. Changes to the top level Makefile.am

Add your plugin (in alphabetical order) to plugin_ldadd:

if HAVE_PLUGINS

plugin_ldadd = $(_CUSTOM_plugin_ldadd_) \
	...
        -dlopen plugins/unistim/unistim.la \
        -dlopen plugins/wimax/wimax.la \
        -dlopen plugins/wimaxmacphy/wimaxmacphy.la \
        -dlopen plugins/hpsdr_u/hpsdr_u.la


Add "-dlopen plugins/hpsdr_u/hpsdr_u.la" to the end of the list. 
An example is above. YOU NEED TO ADD " \" TO THE END OF THE LINE 
ABOVE WHERE YOU ADD "-dlopen plugins/hpsdr_u/hpsdr_u.la".
Do not add spaces from the beginning of the line, add white space as a TAB.
Also do not add any white space after the "\".

3.  Changes to the top level configure.ac

You need to add your plugins Makefile to the AC_CONFIG_FILES rule in
the configure.ac file.

AC_CONFIG_FILES(
  ...
  plugins/unistim/Makefile
  plugins/wimax/Makefile
  plugins/wimaxasncp/Makefile
  plugins/wimaxmacphy/Makefile
  plugins/hpsdr_u/Makefile
  randpkt_core/doxygen.cfg
  randpkt_core/Makefile
  tools/Makefile
  ...
  _CUSTOM_AC_OUTPUT_
)

Add "plugins/hpsdr_u/Makefile" after the last "plugins" line. An 
example is above.


4.  Changes to epan/Makefile.am

Add the relative path of all your plugin source files to plugin_src:

plugin_src = \
        ...
        ../plugins/wimax/wimax_harq_map_decoder.c \
        ../plugins/wimax/wimax_pdu_decoder.c \
        ../plugins/wimax/wimax_phy_attributes_decoder.c \
        ../plugins/wimax/wimax_tlv.c \
        ../plugins/wimax/wimax_utils.c \
        ../plugins/hpsdr_u/packet-hpsdr_u.c 

Add "../plugins/packet-hpsdr_u.c" to the end of the list. An example is
above. YOU NEED TO ADD " \" TO THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE WHERE YOU 
ADD "../plugins/packet-hpsdr_u.c".
Do not add spaces, add white space with a TAB.

5.  Changes to CMakeLists.txt

Add your plugin to the PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS:

if(ENABLE_PLUGINS)
        ...
        set(PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS
                ...
                plugins/unistim
                plugins/wimax
                plugins/wimaxasncp
                plugins/wimaxmacphy
                plugins/hpsdr_u
                ${CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR}
        )

Add "plugins/hpsdr_u" to the end of the list. An example is above.


Linux Instructions
------------------
Down load the source and make the changes to the Wireshark source Build Files

-Copy the "hpsdr_u" to the "plugins" directory.
--- Download and unpack the hpsdr_u plug-in source to some where.
--- cd <SOME PATH>/hpsdr-u-wireshark-plugin-<VERSION>
--- cp -r hpsdr_u <SOME PATH>/wireshark-<VERSION>/plugins/

-Generate Plug-in Build Files
-- Make the change to Wireshark build files. See the "Add The Plug-in to 
-- The Wireshark Build Files" above in this document.
--
-- Run this commands from the root directory of the Wireshark source.
-- automake 
-- autoconf
-- ./configure
--
-- You may need to use options when running the configure script if
-- you do not have all the default libraries installed. The default is that
-- the Wireshark GUI will be compiled. Running the configure script with 
-- "--disable-wireshark" will tell the script not to look for the Xorg, QT, and 
-- GTK libraries. 

-Compile the Plug-in
-- Start at the root directory of the Wireshark source.
-- cd plugins/hpsdr_u
-- make

-Install the Plug-in in Default Location 
-- This will install the plug-in to the default location.
-- The default is /usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/<VERSION>/
-- This can be change when running "./configure in the Build Files step.
-- From the Wireshark source directory run "./configure --help". Review
-- the "--prefix=" option.
--
-- Run this command from the <wireshark source>/plugins/hpsdr_u directory.
-- The command needs to run as the root user. The sudo command will run the
-- command as the root user.
--
-- sudo make install

-Manually Install the Plug-in
-- You need to discover where Wireshark looks for Plug-ins.
-- Open the Wireshark GUI.
-- Goto the Help Menu.
-- Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
-- Click on the Plugins tab.
-- Look and see where the other plugins are located.
--
-- Run this command from the <wireshark source>/plugins/hpsdr_u directory.
-- The command needs to run as the root user. The sudo command will run the
-- command as the root user.
--
-- sudo cp .libs/hpsdr_u.so <location of other plug-ins>
--
-- This step is optional but recommended. This step installs the libtool
-- library file. This file lists the library dependences of the plug-in.
-- The command needs to run as the root user. The sudo command will run the
-- command as the root user. 
-- 
-- sudo cp .libs/hpsdr_u.la <location of other plug-ins>

-Validate Plug-in Installation
--Open the Wireshark GUI.
-- Goto the Help Menu.
-- Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
-- Click on the Plugins tab.
-- Find "hpsdr_u.so" in the "Name" column.
-- You can also validate the version of the plug-in 
-- in the "Version" column.
--
-- Finally capture and disassemble some traffic!


MS Windows Instructions
-----------------------
I started out trying to provide a list of steps needed to compile the plug-in on 
Windows. Compiling Wireshark and it's plug-ins for MS Windows is not trivial. Below 
is more a set of notes on how to compile Wireshark.


To do a full compile of Wireshark for Windows review:

https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChSetupWin32.html 
and
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChSetupCMake.html

The instructions below where developed using the two links above. The steps 
below have been tested on Windows 10 Pro.


-Install Wireshark 
-- Goto wireshark.org and download the installer For windows.
-- Run the Wireshark installed. DO NOT FORGET TO INSTALL
-- WINPCAP! The winpcap driver is what allows Wireshark to
-- capture the Ethernet frames.
-- Winpcap does not work with all network drivers on Windows 10.
-- You may need to remove WinPcap and install Win10-Pcap, 
-- http://www.win10pcap.org/  


-Install Chocolatey
-- Open a Administrative Command Prompt
-- Enter the command below and press enter. 
-- ( The command is from the home page of chocolatey.org)
--
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
--
-- 

-Install Install Microsoft C compiler and SDK
-- From Administrative Command Prompt
--
-- choco install VisualStudioCommunity2013
--
-- Answer "yes" to the question.
-- Wait for Visual Studio to install.
--

-Install Cygwin
-- From Administrative Command Prompt
--
-- choco install cygwin
--  
-- YES - Accept the license
-- When you see "Cygwin has been installed."
-- Press: Ctrl-C
-- 
-- choco install cyg-get 
--
-- YES - Accept the license
--
-- choco install winflexbison   
--
-- Answer "yes" to the question.
!!!!!! DID not install Interpreters/perl!!!!
!!! text/sciidoc
!!! text/docbook-xml45
-- use cygwinsetup to install -located:
-- c:\ProgramData\chcolatey\lib\Cygwin\tools\cygwin

-Install Python
-- From Administrative Command Prompt
--
-- choco install python2
--
-- YES - Accept the license

-Install CMake
-- From Administrative Command Prompt
--
-- choco install cmake.portable
-- YES - Accept the license
--


-Unpack the Wireshark Source.
--Click on the Cygwin Terminal Icon on the desktop
--Enter the command to change the working directory:
-- cd /cygdrive/c/Users/<USER NAME>/<Where you downloaded the Wireshark Source>
--  Change the command if needed. The key is "/cygdrive/" after that its just 
--  a normal UNIX file path. I downloaded the source to my download directory. 
--  My version of the command was:
--  "cd /cygdrive/c/Users/Matthew/Downloads"
--
-- Create a directory to unpack the source into. I used "build" in my 
-- Document directory.
--
-- tar xfj ./wireshark-<version>.tar.bz2 -C <destination directory>   
--  Since the Document and Download directories have the same parent directory
--  my command was "tar xfj ./wireshark-<version>.tar.bz2 -C ../Documents/build
--

-Copy the plug-in source in the Source Tree
--I assume that if you are reading this file you have all ready unpack the 
--Plug-in source.
--
--Copy the hpsdr_u directory from the plug-in source to the "plugins" 

-Generate Plug-in Build Files
-- Make the change to Wireshark build files. See the "Add The Plug-in to 
-- The Wireshark Build Files" above in this document.
-- The files are UNIX text files use WorkPad to edit the files.
--

-Open Visual Studio Command Prompt
-- Goto the Visual Studio Tools directory.
-- Open the Command Prompt for architecture you want to compile.
-- Enter:
-- set CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
-- set WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR=<location of Wireshark Source>
--  My version was "set WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR=c:\Users\Matthew\build\Wireshark-<VER>
--
--set WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM=win64 
-- or win32 as required
--
-- Change the active directory to where the Wireshark source is located.
-- cd <wireshark root source>
-- 
-- Make the build subdirectory.  The build is going to use CMake. With CMake is
-- is best to create a build directory. I used "wsbuild64".
--  mkdir wsbuild64
--
-- Change the active directory to the build directory.
--  cd wsbuild64
--

-Generate Build Files
-- Run this command from the build directory.
-- Run the command in the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
--
-- cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=c:/tools/python2/python -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ..
--
-- You may need to change the -G option if you are not compiling for Win64.
-- "cmake -G" will list the available options
-- You will need Internet access. Needed software packages and libraries may  
-- be downloaded.
--

-Compile the Plug-in
-Generate Build Files
-- Run this command from the build directory.
-- Run the command in the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
--
-- msbuild /m /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo Wireshark.sln
--

-Manually Install the Plug-in
-- You need to discover where Wireshark looks for Plug-ins.
-- Open the Wireshark GUI.
-- Goto the Help Menu.
-- Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
-- Click on the Plugins tab.
-- Look and see where the other plugins are located.
-- When I installed the Wireshark via the installer, Wireshark was
-- expecting the plug-ins in the the directory:
-- C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\<version>\
--
-- copy the file: <build dir>\run\RelWithDebinfo\plugins\hpsdr_u.dll
-- to wherever Wireshark is looking for plug-ins.
--

-Validate Plug-in Installation
--Open the Wireshark GUI.
-- Goto the Help Menu.
-- Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
-- Click on the Plugins tab.
-- Find "hpsdr_u.dll" in the "Name" column.
-- You can also validate the version of the plug-in 
-- in the "Version" column.
--
-- Finally capture and disassemble some traffic!
