1. Remove old Plug-in Library File
----------------------------------

Starting with version 0.3.0 the name of the plug-in library file has changed.

Do you have any older version of the plug-in installed?

If yes, you need to remove the older plug-in file before installing the 
the new plug-in.

  A. Unix / Linux Plug-in Library File Removal
  --------------------------------------------
  1. You need to discover where Wireshark looks for Plug-ins.
     a. Open the Wireshark GUI.
     b. Go to the Help Menu.
     c. Open the "About Wireshark Menu".
     d. Click on the Plugins tab.
     e.Look and see where the other plugins are located.

  2. Remove old plug-in library file.

     sudo rm <location of other plug-ins>/hpsdr_u.so

  B. Microsoft Windows Plug-in Library File Removal
  -------------------------------------------------
  1. Delete the file listed below. 
     C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\<version>\hpsdr-u.dll

2. Compile the Plug-in
----------------------

Version 0.3.0 was developed with Wireshark 3.0.1.

I assuming that that build environment for Wireshark has all ready been
created.

There are two ways to compile the plug-in. Outside or inside the 
Wireshark source tree.


  A. Build the Plug-in Out Side of the Wireshark Source Tree
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  !!! THIS DOES NOT WORK !!!
  - There is an issue with the plug-in source file name that causes the
    plug-in version not to be set in the library file.

  You will need to have the Wireshark development libraries installed.

  1. Unpack the plug-in source file somewhere.

  2. Enter the plug-in source directory.

   cd openhpsdr-u

  3. Create the build directory.

    cd <Wireshark Source Root>
    mkdir build

  4. Enter the Build directory and run cmake.

    cd build
    cmake ..  

  6. Run make to build the plug-in.

    cd <Plug-in Source Root>/build
    make <Your Favorite Options>

  7. Install the plug-in.

    sudo make install

  I used the <Wireshark 3.0.1>/doc/plugins.example/README as reference.

  B. Build the Plug-in in the Wireshark Source Tree
  ----------------------------------------------

  You need the Wireshark sources to compile the plug-in in the 
  Wireshark source tree. It is best to compile Wireshark before compiling the 
  plug-in. Compiling Wireshark will validate that you have all libraries needed
  to compile the plug-in.

  1. Unpack the plug-in source file somewhere.

  2. Copy and or move the "openhpsdr-u" directory from the plug-in source
     into the Wireshark source tree.
     A. Copy or move the "openhpsdr-u" into
        <Wireshark Source Root>/plugins/epan 

  3. Add the plug-in to root CMakeLists.txt file.
     A. Add the plug-in directory to the PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS set.

  if(ENABLE_PLUGINS)
          ...
          set(PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS
                  ...
                  plugins/unistim
                  plugins/wimax
                  plugins/wimaxasncp
                  plugins/wimaxmacphy
                  plugins/openhpsdr-u
                  ${CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR}
          )

  Add "plugins/openhpsdr-u" to the end of the list. An example is above.

  4.Create the build directory.

    cd <Wireshark Source Root>
    mkdir build

  5. Enter the Build directory and run cmake.

    cd build
    cmake ..

  6. Run make to build Wireshark and the plug-in.

   cd <Wireshark Source Root>/build
   make <Your Favorite Options>

  7. Install Wireshark and the plug-in.

    sudo make install
